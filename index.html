                Bangladesh have ended New Zealand’s 17-match unbeaten run on home soil with a stunning eight-wicket
                victory at Mount Maunganui.

                The world Test champions were dismissed for 169 in their second innings, with Bangladesh knocking off
                the 40 runs required for victory for the loss of two wickets as the tourists beat New Zealand in a Test
                match for the first time.

                The hosts had begun day five on 147 for 5, a slender lead of 17 runs, and were quickly on the back foot
                as the seamer Ebadot Hossain clean-bowled Ross Taylor for 40, then removed Kyle Jamieson for a duck in
                his first two overs. Taskin Ahmed chipped in with the wicket of the all-rounder Rachin Ravindra for 16.

                The Black Caps were rocking on 160 for 8 and Bangladesh finished them off, Taskin removing Tim Southee’s
                middle stump before Trent Boult departed for eight as he holed out in the deep. There was a brief early
                wobble for the tourists when Shadman Islam was caught behind for three off Southee’s bowling.
